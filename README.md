## About Me

Engineering student specializing in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.

My work combines:

- AI systems (Multi-Agent RL, decision systems)
- Offensive security
- Embedded firmware analysis
- Low-level system behavior

I am particularly interested in how intelligent systems interact with constrained and secure environments.
