## About Me

I specialize in offensive security for embedded and low-level systems.

My focus areas:

- Firmware analysis (STM32, ARM Cortex-M33)
- TrustZone security boundaries
- Reverse engineering (Ghidra, IDA)
- Binary exploitation
- Secure / Non-secure memory separation attacks
- Zephyr OS security

I believe real understanding comes from breaking systems.
